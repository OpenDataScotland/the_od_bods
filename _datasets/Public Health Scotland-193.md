notes: "<p>As an essential service, maternity care including \u2018booking\u2019 has\
  \ been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and women have been encouraged\
  \ to attend all their scheduled antenatal appointments. However, how some elements\
  \ of maternity care are delivered has changed in order to minimise the number of\
  \ visits women need to make. The \u2018booking\u2019 appointment is the first main\
  \ appointment a woman has with her local maternity service once she knows she is\
  \ pregnant. At the booking appointment, women are assessed by a midwife who can\
  \ then tailor the subsequent care they receive during their pregnancy to their particular\
  \ preferences and needs. Women are encouraged to book before they are 13 weeks pregnant,\
  \ and ideally before they are 10 weeks pregnant. </p>\n<p>In general, prior to COVID-19,\
  \ women were offered an initial in-person booking appointment (including various\
  \ face to face tests such as blood tests and blood pressure monitoring) then a follow\
  \ up appointment for their early pregnancy ultrasound scan. Since March 2020, in\
  \ many areas women have been offered an initial remote consultation, then an in-person\
  \ \u2018one stop\u2019 follow up appointment for all their face to face tests and\
  \ their scan.</p>\n<p>This dataset shows the number of women booking for antenatal\
  \ care in each week from the week beginning 1 April 2019 onwards. In addition to\
  \ the weekly data, monthly data (based on exact month of booking rather than summation\
  \ of sequential weeks) is presented for each NHS Board of residence, including the\
  \ Island Boards. Due to small numbers, weekly data is not shown for individual Island\
  \ Boards of residence (NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland, and NHS Western Isles), however\
  \ the Island Boards are included in the Scotland total.</p>\n<p>This data is also\
