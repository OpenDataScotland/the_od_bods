notes: "<p>The Place Standard is used to evaluate the quality of a \u201Cplace\u201D\
  . It can evaluate places that are well-established, undergoing change, or still\
  \ being planned. The tool can also help users to identify their  priorities. This\
  \ was one of the main methods used by Community Regeneration staff and partner organisations\
  \ to inform the Engage Dundee consultation which was undertaken between June 2016\
  \ and March 2017.</p>\n<p>Findings from the Engage Dundee consultation will directly\
  \ inform the key priorities in Local Community Plans currently being developed in\
  \ each multi-member Ward. The consultation was also used to identify priorities\
  \ to inform the Local Outcome Improvement Plan and potentially how the new Community\
  \ Infrastructure Fund is allocated.</p>\n<p>The survey consisted of questions which\
  \ cover both the physical and social elements of a \u201Cplace.\u201D. </p>\n<p>You\
