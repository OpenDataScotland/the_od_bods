notes: '<p>The main function of CAMHS is to develop and deliver services for those
  children and young people (and their parents/carers) who are experiencing the most
  serious mental health problems. They also have an important role in supporting the
  mental health capability of the wider network of children''s services. CAMHS are
  usually delivered by multidisciplinary teams including nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists,
  social workers, and others.</p>

  <p>Delivery of good quality CAMHS depends on adequate numbers of well trained staff
  being recruited and retained across NHSScotland. Practitioners who contribute to
  CAMHS include: psychiatric nurses, child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical
  psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists (including child/analytical, systemic/family,
  cognitive behavioural), creative therapists (including art, music and drama), play
  therapists, liaison teachers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists
  and dieticians.</p>

  <p>Timely access to healthcare is a key measure of quality and that applies equally
  in respect of access to mental health services. Early action is more likely to result
  in full recovery and, in the case of children and young people, will also minimise
  the impact on other aspects of their development such as their education, so improving
  their wider social development outcomes.</p>

  <p>CAMHS are subject to deliver an 18 week wait from referral to treatment for specialist
  services this has been the standard since December 2014. This supersedes the previous
  target of 26 weeks. The data shows the performances of the board in relation to
  this standard.</p>'
