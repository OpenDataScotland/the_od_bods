notes: "<p>Moray Onshore Wind Energy 2017 Policy Guidance Map for Small-Medium Typologies\
  \ (Moray) Areas of Greatest Potential. Scottish Planning Policy states that planning\
  \ authorities \u201Cshould identify where there is strategic capacity for wind farms,\
  \ and areas with the greatest potential for wind development\u201D. Areas of greatest\
  \ scope for further investigating the feasibility of developing wind farms. These\
  \ areas have been identified on Policy Guidance maps by removing additional constraints\
  \ from the spatial framework map of the areas likely to be most appropriate for\
  \ wind farm development. The remaining areas which have been mapped for each development\
  \ typology are the areas with the fewest constraints and therefore the greatest\
  \ potential for wind farm developments. </p>"
