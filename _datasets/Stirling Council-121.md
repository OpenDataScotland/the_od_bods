notes: "<p><strong>This group details the output from transport monitoring of cyclist\
  \ and pedestrian activity within Stirling.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Outputs from\
  \ the monitors feed into Stirling Council\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/\"\
  ><strong>Local Transport Strategy (LTS)</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cycle\
  \ and pedestrian data are gathered using cabinets located at the side of footways\
  \ and cycleways, which detect pedestrians using an infra-red beam, and cyclists\
  \ using piezoelectric strips.  The devices used are encrypted, and anonymise any\
  \ data collected, so no pedestrians or cyclists can be traced.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The\
  \ movements which pass through the detection zone of the counters are classified\
  \ based on which sensors are triggered by the movement.  Where the pedestrian infra-red\
  \ beam is triggered but not the piezo electric strips, the movement is a pedestrian.\
  \  Where both the infra-red beam and the piezo electric strips are triggered, the\
  \ movement is a cyclist.  The piezo electric strips are installed below the surface\
  \ of the footway and so when cut, will fail to record anything.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In\
  \ August 2019, the number of locations at which monitors are located increased to\
  \ 23 with the addition of three sites around Craig\u2019s Roundabout. These were\
  \ installed to allow the figures generated from them to be combined with those from\
  \ the Kerse Road Bridge to provide origin-destination data for the network of pathways\
  \ going through the roundabout.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trafficscotland.org/\"\
  ><strong>Traffic Scotland </strong></a> <strong>can provide updates on any road\
  \ closures and the </strong><a href=\"https://www.roadworksscotland.org/\"><strong>Scottish\
  \ Roadworks Commissioner </strong></a><strong>can give further details on any planned\
  \ roadworks throughout the country.</strong></p>"
