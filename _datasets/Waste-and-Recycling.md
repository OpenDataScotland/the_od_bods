notes: Local authorities are required to report to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) about waste collected and managed by or on behalf of them. This is done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF). Reports are submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.  

Local authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data Unit and are used to help fulfill Scotland’s reporting obligations to the Scottish Government and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland’s Environment [Household Waste Data Analysis Tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/). The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type for 2011 – 2015 and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. 

The Scotland’s Environment [Waste Discover Data tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/) presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types for 2011 – 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005.

All data can be exported to Excel if required.
