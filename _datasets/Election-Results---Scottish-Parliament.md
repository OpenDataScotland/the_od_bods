title: Election Results - Scottish Parliament
organization: Aberdeen City Council
notes: In Scottish parliamentary elections voters use the **first past the post system** to elect constituency Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs).  Aberdeen city has three constituencies: 

* **Aberdeen Donside**
* **Aberdeen Central**
* **Aberdeen South and North Kincardine**

At the same time voters also elect seven regional MSPs using the additional member system of **proportional representation**. This system uses **regional lists** which include candidates selected by political parties and independent candidates.  Aberdeen is in the **North East Scotland region**.
