notes: "<p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. </p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic\
  \ has wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,\
  \ than those that occur as the direct result of infection.\nReasons for this may\
  \ include:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because\
  \ they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.</p>\n\
  <p>\u2022 The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some\
  \ screening services and planned surgery.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Other indirect effects\
  \ of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences\
  \ of distancing measures.</p>\n<p>This dataset provides information on trend data\
  \ regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on contacts with NHS 24. Information\
  \ is shown for patients in different age groups; for males and females; and for\
  \ people living in areas with different levels of material deprivation. Information\
  \ is also available at different levels of geographical breakdown such as Health\
  \ Boards, Health and Social Care partnerships, and Scotland totals. </p>\n<p>This\
