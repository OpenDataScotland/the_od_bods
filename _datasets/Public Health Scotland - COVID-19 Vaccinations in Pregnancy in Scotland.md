notes: '<p>This dataset presents information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to
  pregnant women in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been used since the start of the
  vaccination programme on 8 December 2020. The Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine has been
  used from 4 January 2021 and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April 2021. </p>

  <p>Women can receive a first or second dose, or both doses, of COVID-19 vaccination
  during pregnancy, depending on when they become eligible for vaccination and how
  this relates to the dates of their pregnancy.</p>

  <p>PHS has generated this information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to pregnant
  women by linking national data on vaccinations to the COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland
  (COPS) study database of pregnant women in Scotland.</p>

  <p>As part of the COPS study, PHS is regularly linking together a wide range of
  health records to identify women who are, or recently have been, pregnant.  The
  specific records used include:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Records of booking for antenatal care</li>

  <li>GP records relating to miscarriage</li>

  <li>Hospital discharge records relating to miscarriage or delivery of a live or
  stillborn baby</li>

  <li>Statutory termination of pregnancy notification records</li>

  <li>Statutory live or stillbirth registration records</li>

  <li>NHS live birth notification records.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Using these records, we have identified all women in Scotland who were pregnant
  on 1 March 2020 (the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), and all women who have subsequently
  become pregnant.  </p>

  <p>The study database is refreshed every month with new pregnancies added to the
  database, and previous records of ongoing pregnancies updated as required, for example
  if a woman has recently delivered her baby.</p>

  Institute webpage</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/COPS-public">PHS
