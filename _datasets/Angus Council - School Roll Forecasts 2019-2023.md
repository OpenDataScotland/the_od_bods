notes: "<p>School Roll Forecasts\nView our 2017 based school roll forecasts for Angus\u2019\
  s primary and secondary schools until 2023.\nThe forecasts take as their starting\
  \ point the current school population. They then attempt to identify how that population\
  \ may change over time. In doing so they take into account demographic factors such\
  \ as birth and migration rates and changes to the school roll arising from new housing.\
  \ They also build in information about school choices made under the Parents\u2019\
  \ Charter. In secondary schools staying-on rates for pupils entering fifth and sixth\
  \ year are estimated. Finally, numbers are rounded to whole figures, a process which\
  \ occasionally introduces rounding errors into individual school totals.\nThe forecasts\
  \ include a comparison of the current and forecast school roll with the formal capacity\
  \ of a school.\nThere is considerable interest in the effect of new house building\
  \ on school rolls. Projected new house figures used in these forecasts are based\
  \ on the 2018 Draft Housing Land Audit, supplemented, where appropriate, by site\
  \ specific intelligence. As ever, it cannot be guaranteed that the exact number\
  \ of houses specified in the Housing Land Audit will be built or that the build\
  \ rates will follow precisely the build schedule given.\nIn general, it is easier\
  \ to produce accurate forecasts for large schools than for small ones. Any, or all,\
  \ of the factors mentioned above may vary in the course of a year. The smaller the\
  \ school the more significant variations will be. The roll of a small primary school\
  \ can be disproportionately affected, either positively or negatively, by the movement\
  \ of one or two families. School forecasts, therefore, can, and often do, change\
  \ from year to year. They remain the best estimate that can be arrived at, using\
  \ data currently available. </p>"
