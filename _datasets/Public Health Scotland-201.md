notes: "<p>Care for women around the time they are giving birth is an essential, time\
  \ critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has been provided throughout\
  \ the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support\
  \ other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed\
  \ in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow\
  \ services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff\
  \ may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.</p>\n<p>Guidance issued\
  \ by the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\
  \ to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:</p>\n\
  <p>\u2022   It may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for\
  \ women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery\
  \ care within obstetric units.</p>\n<p>\u2022   Additional restrictions on the use\
  \ of water births were recommended.</p>\n<p>\u2022   Care pathways for women requiring\
  \ induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction\
  \ process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible.</p>\n<p>\u2022\
  \   Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective\
  \ caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been\
  \ in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so.</p>\n<p>\u2022   Services should\
  \ support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever\
  \ possible.</p>\n<p>\u2022   In general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients\
  \ in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied\
  \ by their chosen birth partner.</p>\n<p>The \u2018method of delivery' refers to\
  \ the way a baby is born. Different methods of delivery include spontaneous vaginal\
  \ delivery (a natural birth); assisted vaginal delivery (including vaginal delivery\
  \ by forceps or ventouse, or vaginal delivery of a breech baby); or a caesarean\
  \ section (an operation to deliver the baby through a cut in the mother\u2019s abdomen).\
  \ A caesarean section can be elective (planned in advance and provided before labour\
  \ has started) or emergency (unplanned, and usually but not always provided after\
  \ labour has started).</p>\n<p>This dataset shows information on method of delivery\
  \ at Scotland and  NHS Board level. Age and deprivation breakdown is also available\
  \ at Scotland level. </p>\n<p>This data is also available on the <a href=\"https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/\"\
