notes: '<p>The Scottish Government Urban Rural Classification provides a consistent
  way of defining urban and rural areas across Scotland. The classification is based
  upon two main criteria: (i) population as defined by the National Records of Scotland,
  and (ii) accessibility based on drive time analysis to differentiate between accessible
  and remote areas in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are four levels for classification </p>

  <ul>

  <li>

  <p>2-fold </p>
