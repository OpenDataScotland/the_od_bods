notes: "<p>Local authorities are required to report to the Scottish Environmental\
  \ Protection Agency (SEPA) about waste collected and managed by or on behalf of\
  \ them. This is done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF).\
  \ Reports are submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.\
  \  </p>\n<p>Local authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data\
  \ Unit and are used to help fulfill Scotland\u2019s reporting obligations to the\
  \ Scottish Government and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate\
  \ Scotland\u2019s Environment <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/\"\
  >Household Waste Data Analysis Tool</a>. The tool shows a break-down of household\
  \ waste generated and managed by waste type for 2011 \u2013 2015 and the trends\
