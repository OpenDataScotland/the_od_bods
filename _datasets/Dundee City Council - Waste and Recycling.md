notes: "Local authorities are required to report to the Scottish Environmental Protection\
  \ Agency (SEPA) about waste collected and managed by or on behalf of them. This\
  \ is done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF). Reports\
  \ are submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.  \n\
  \nLocal authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data Unit and\
  \ are used to help fulfill Scotland\u2019s reporting obligations to the Scottish\
  \ Government and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland\u2019\
  s Environment [Household Waste Data Analysis Tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/).\
  \ The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste\
  \ type for 2011 \u2013 2015 and the trends for household waste generated, recycled\
  \ and managed since 2004. \n\nThe Scotland\u2019s Environment [Waste Discover Data\
  \ tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/)\
  \ presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition\
  \ sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types\
  \ for 2011 \u2013 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005.\n\
  \nAll data can be exported to Excel if required."
