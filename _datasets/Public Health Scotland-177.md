notes: '<p>In order to provide an effective, safe and efficient service to patients,
  hospitals must balance the provision of staffed beds against anticipated demand.
  Historically, the total number of beds has been reducing in line with evolving models
  of healthcare provision which aim to reduce the frequency and duration of hospital
  admissions and improve the integration of health and social care services. This
  strategy aims to improve outcomes for patients and reduce the likelihood of future
  hospital admissions.</p>
