  Moray Council this includes applications Moray Council dealt with and Section 36
  applications which were dealt with by Scottish Government. It also includes refused

  maybe for the same site where the applicant has submitted a revised application
  to change turbine size/location etc.Any turbine location co-ordinates we provide
  will not be exact locations taken from GPS or similar. The co-ordinates will be
  either calculated from plans provide by the applicant or grid co-ordinates stated
  in the application, these co-ordinates will not take into account for any micro-siting
