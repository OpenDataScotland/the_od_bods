notes: '<p>As an essential service, care relating to termination of pregnancy has
  been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Termination of pregnancy can be
  carried out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical
  terminations involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart
  to end her pregnancy. Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination
  were required to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first
  and then, separately, the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an
  early medical termination (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take
  the second medicine away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently
  take that at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women
  requiring an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation)
  have been able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call,
  then take both medicines at home.</p>

  <p>Termination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced abortion)
  is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations.
  When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal
  requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within
  seven days of it taking place. Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation
  of data derived from notifications of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the
  Chief Medical Officer. Detailed information on terminations is published each year
  by Public Health Scotland. The most recent report covers the year to December 2019.</p>

  <p>This dataset presents information on the number of terminations of pregnancy
  carried out in Scotland, and the average gestation (stage of pregnancy) at which
  they occurred. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken
  down by age group and deprivation. </p>

  <p>This data is also available on the COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard. Additional
