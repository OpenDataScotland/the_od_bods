notes: "<p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. </p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic\
  \ has wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,\
  \ than those that occur as the direct result of infection.\nReasons for this may\
  \ include:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because\
  \ they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.</p>\n\
  <p>\u2022 The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some\
  \ screening services and planned surgery.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Other indirect effects\
  \ of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences\
  \ of distancing measures.</p>\n<p>This dataset provides information on trend data\
  \ regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on Scottish Ambulance Services. Data\
  \ are shown by age group, sex and broad deprivation category (SIMD), as well as\
  \ by different levels of geographical breakdown such as Health Boards, Health and\
  \ Social Care partnerships, and Scotland totals. </p>\n<p>Please note that the source\
  \ of this data is the Unscheduled Care Datamart and represents a sub-set of the\
  \ total Scottish Ambulance service activity. Figures include emergencies, where\
  \ a vehicle arrived at the scene of the incident, and excludes both data from resources\
  \ which were cleared as \u2018dealt with by another vehicle\u2019 and air ambulance\
  \ data. The figures presented in this dataset relate to incidents concerning both\
  \ COVID-19 and non-COVID issues. </p>\n<p>This data is also available on the <a\
