notes: "<p>The Hands Up Scotland Survey looks at how pupils across the country travel\
  \ to school and nursery.</p>\n<p>The project is funded by Transport Scotland and\
  \ is a joint survey between Sustrans and all 32 Scottish local authorities.</p>\n\
  <p>Each September, schools across Scotland complete the survey by asking their pupils\
  \ \u2018How do you normally travel to school?\u2019. Council staff distribute the\
  \ survey to schools and return pupil responses to the Sustrans\u2019 Research and\
  \ Monitoring Unit for overall collation, analysis and reporting.</p>\n<p>The most\
  \ recent results, published on 24th June 2021 in the 2020 Annual Report, provide\
  \ a valuable snapshot of school travel in Scotland.</p>"
