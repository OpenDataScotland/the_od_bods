title: Listed Buildings
organization: Dundee City Council
notes: Buildings are listed by Historic Scotland for their special architectural or historic interest on behalf of the Scottish Government. The aim of listing such buildings is to protect or enhance their special character by affording them statutory protection. The principles for listing buildings are fairly complex and there is no right of appeal against the Scottish Governments decision to list a property. Listed buildings are listed in 3 categories - A, B and C;

* __Category A__ listed buildings are of national or international importance. 
* __Category B__ listed buildings are of regional importance. 
* __Category C__ buildings are of local importance. 

A building's listing covers its interior, exterior and any object or structure fixed to a building or which falls within the curtilage of such a building, forming part of the land since before 1 July 1948.
