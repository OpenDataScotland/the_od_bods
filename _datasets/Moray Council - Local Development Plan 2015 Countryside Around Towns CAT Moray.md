notes: "<p>The Local Development Plan 2015 was superseded by the Local Development\
  \ Plan 2020 on 27 July 2020.The five main towns of Elgin, Forres, Buckie, Keith\
  \ and Lossiemouth are subject to the highest development pressures and Countryside\
  \ Around Towns (CAT\u2019s) have been designated to prevent development sprawl into\
  \ the countryside. Only certain types of development are appropriate within CAT\u2019\
  s to protect their special character. New housing development is specifically excluded\
  \ from the types of acceptable development to maintain and preserve the distinction\
  \ with the built up area.</p>"
