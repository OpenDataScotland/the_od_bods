organization: Moray Council
notes: Secondary School Catchments 24/10/2016 - 13/08/2017 (Moray) (non denominational)In  Moray, the education authority discharges its duty to secure adequate  and efficient education for the local authority area by operating a  “catchment area” system to enable parents/carers to comply with their  duty to provide efficient education for their child(ren).  The zones  (catchment areas) are shown as delineated areas on maps.  Information on  these catchment areas is available at the Moray Council website.Most  parents of children living within the catchment area will choose for  their children to attend the designated primary and secondary school for  their catchment area.If  a parent wishes their child to be enrolled at a school which is not the  designated catchment area school for their postal address, they must  make an out-of-zone ‘placing request’.
