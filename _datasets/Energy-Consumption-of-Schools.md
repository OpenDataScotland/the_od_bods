title: Energy Consumption of Schools
organization: Dundee City Council
notes: Energy usage recorded every half hour for primary and high schools in Dundee City. Data is given for gas and electricity usage and is the summation of readings taken from one or more meters within individual schools. To consider when looking at energy usage for individual schools: 

* School buildings and facilities noticeably vary. Some schools use older buildings which limit their energy efficiency. Some schools have swimming pools or other facilities that lead to a higher energy usage.
* School sizes differ considerably, as do the number of attending pupils and staff.
* Schools may be used during the evening and weekends for after-school clubs, community activities and other events. Schools may also be used in the mornings for breakfast clubs.
* Weather conditions affect the amount of energy used by schools.
* All the above factors and more can change the energy usage profile of the school and should be considered when viewing the data.
