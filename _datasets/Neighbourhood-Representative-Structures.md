title: Neighbourhood Representative Structures
organization: Dundee City Council
notes: Neighbourhood Representative Structures are supported and recognised by Dundee City Council in a similar way to Community Councils, and both have a right to consultation on matters relating to their neighbourhood. This dataset shows the active neighbourhood representation that the Council consults with across the City.

For Community Council boundaries only see the related Community Council Wards dataset. 

Background on the formation and recognition of Neighbourhood Representative Structures is available in the Neighbourhood Resource and Development Committee report number 752-2002.
