  \ is aggregated from the population estimates for 2011 Data Zones.Data zones are\
  \ the small area geography used by the Scottish Government to allow statistics to\
  \ be available across a number of policy areas. Data zones were initially set up\
  \ to nest within council area boundaries and to have a population of between 500\
  \ and 1,000 household residents. As much as possible, data zones were set up to\
  \ contain households with similar social characteristics and to take into consideration\
  \ physical boundaries. More information on data zone geography can be found on the\_\
  Scottish Government\_website. There are 6,976 data zones in Scotland.Following the\
  \ 2011 Census the Scottish Government completed a consultation on the redrawing\
  \ of data zone boundary and finalised the new data zones. 2011 Data Zones were published\
  \ at the end of 2014.Intermediate zones are built up from data zones. Intermediate\
  \ zones are the statistical small geographical areas designed to contain a population\
  \ of between 2,500 and 6,000 household residents. There are 1,235 intermediate zones\
  \ in Scotland. More information on intermediate geography can be found on the\_\
  Scottish Government\_website.For more information on population statistics, please\
