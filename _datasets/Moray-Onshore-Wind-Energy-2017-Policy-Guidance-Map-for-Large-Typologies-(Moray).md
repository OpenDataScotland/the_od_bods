title: Moray Onshore Wind Energy 2017 Policy Guidance Map for Large Typologies (Moray)
organization: Moray Council
notes: Moray Onshore Wind Energy 2017 Policy Guidance Map for Large Typologies (Moray) Areas of Greatest Potential. Scottish Planning Policy states that planning authorities “should identify where there is strategic capacity for wind farms, and areas with the greatest potential for wind development”. Areas of greatest scope for further investigating the feasibility of developing wind farms. These areas have been identified on Policy Guidance maps by removing additional constraints from the spatial framework map of the areas likely to be most appropriate for wind farm development. The remaining areas which have been mapped for each development typology are the areas with the fewest constraints and therefore the greatest potential for wind farm developments.
