notes: "<p>Care for women and babies around the time they are giving birth/being born\
  \ is an essential, time critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has\
  \ been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity and neonatal staff\
  \ have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements\
  \ of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise\
  \ the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during\
  \ times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing\
  \ to isolate. Relevant guidance has been issued by the Scottish Government, the\
  \ Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the British Association\
  \ for Perinatal Medicine.</p>\n<p>\u2018Gestation at delivery\u2019 refers to the\
  \ number of completed weeks pregnant a woman is when she delivers her baby. Babies\
  \ are \u2018due\u2019 at 40 completed weeks gestation. Those born between 37 and\
  \ 41 weeks inclusive are considered to be born \u2018at term\u2019. Babies born\
  \ at under 37 weeks (more than three weeks before their due date) are considered\
  \ preterm or premature, with those born at under 32 weeks considered very preterm\
  \ and those born at 32 to 36 weeks inclusive considered moderately preterm. Babies\
  \ born at or over 42 weeks (more than two weeks after their due date) are considered\
  \ post-term or over-due. Babies born preterm are at increased risk of both short\
  \ and long term health and developmental problems, with the risk increasing the\
  \ earlier a baby is born. Babies are also at increased risk when pregnancies extend\
  \ post-term, in particular the risk of stillbirth increases from 42 weeks gestation\
  \ onwards.</p>\n<p>This dataset presents information on gestation at delivery. Data\
  \ is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group\
  \ and deprivation. </p>\n<p>This data is also available on the <a href=\"https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/\"\
