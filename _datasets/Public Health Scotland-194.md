notes: "<p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has\
  \ wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,\
  \ than those that occur as the direct result of infection. Reasons for this may\
  \ include:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because\
  \ they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.</p>\n\
  <p>\u2022 The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some\
  \ screening services and planned surgery.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Other indirect effects\
  \ of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences\
  \ of distancing measures.</p>\n<p>This dataset provides information on trend data\
  \ regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular attendances in A&amp;E\
  \ departments. Data is available from the beginning of 2020 along with historical\
  \ activity (average from 2018 and 2019) for comparison purposes. The recent trend\
  \ data for Accident &amp; Emergency Department attendances are shown by age group,\
  \ and by broad area deprivation category (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation,\
  \ SIMD).</p>\n<p>This data is also available on the <a href=\"https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/\"\
