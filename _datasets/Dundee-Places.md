notes: As part of an exciting collaboration with Dundee Place Partnership, [Creative Dundee](https://creativedundee.com/) has been doing some research and consultation to find out more about the cultural and creative happenings across the city. For 5 months, they have been to many of Dundee’s community hubs and events with a big map of the city where people could pin down their favourite places to go, and fill a short survey about the activities they like doing in their free time and what they’d like to see happening across the city. The places are shared in this dataset. Read more about the research and see other results on Creative Dundee's website.
