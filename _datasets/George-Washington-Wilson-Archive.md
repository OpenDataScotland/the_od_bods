title: George Washington Wilson Archive
organization: Aberdeen City Council
notes: George Washington Wilson (1823-1893), born in **Alvah**, Aberdeenshire, was a pioneering Scottish photographer. By the early 1850s he was established in **Aberdeen** as an **artist and portrait photographer**. He received a contract to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and was later commissioned to **illustrate Queen Victoria’s diaries** of her time in Scotland when they were published. By the 1860s he was increasingly focussed on landscapes and stereoscopic views.   
   
This dataset is a list of all the items relating to **George Washington Wilson**, his company and successor companies, held by Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums. We are releasing it as open data to increase public awareness of, and access to, the collection. We hope it may prove useful in identifying which photographic images are unique across public collections in the UK but we're also keen to hear of any novel uses this data is used for.
