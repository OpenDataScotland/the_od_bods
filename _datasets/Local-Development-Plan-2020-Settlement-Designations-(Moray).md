title: Local Development Plan 2020 Settlement Designations (Moray)
organization: Moray Council
notes: Local Development Plan 2020Settlement Designations set out the current and proposed land uses related to the boundaries for the primary, secondary and third tier settlements. In general the land use designations indicate the types of uses that will be acceptable under the terms of the plan. However any proposal for development will also have to satisfy the key governing policies that are set out in the Policy section of the Local Development Plan.
