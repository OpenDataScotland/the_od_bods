notes: "<p>The Local Development Plan 2015 was superseded by the Local Development\
  \ Plan 2020 on 27 July 2020.Local Development Plan Rural Grouping Boundaries depicts\
  \ the small villages/groupings/clusters of houses that will be covered by Policy\
  \ H5 (LDP2015). Proposals associated with any other location will be dealt with\
  \ under H7 (LDP2015), and assessed against criteria such as visual prominence; character;\
  \ settlement pattern; build up. Boundaries have been drawn around these groupings,\
  \ and there will be a presumption in favour of developments within this boundary.\
  \ (The settlement boundary policy E9 (LDP2015) will apply).The concept of identifying\
  \ and promoting rural development in existing \u201Crural communities\u201D was\
  \ originally contained in the 1993-98 Plan. At that time they were identified as\
  \ small rural settlements, which served as social focal points for the surrounding\
  \ area, with the presence of one or more community facilities (school/hall/shop).\
  \ In subsequent Plans, the requirement for community facilities has been reduced,\
  \ and further groupings have been designated based on their status as a cohesive,\
  \ physical grouping. Consolidation of these remains the preference.</p>"
