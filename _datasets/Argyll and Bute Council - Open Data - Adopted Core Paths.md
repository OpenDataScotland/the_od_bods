notes: "<p>Argyll &amp; Bute Council has adopted a Core Paths Plan for the Council\
  \ area, to meet the requirements of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003:\_ It should\
  \ be noted that there is a separate Core Paths Plan for those areas of Argyll that\
  \ fall in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.\_ The Core Paths Plan\
  \ was adopted by the Council on 25 June 2015 following a Local Inquiry.\_ Core Paths\
  \ form the basic framework of paths, linking with other access provision. Any route\
  \ across land or inland water can be a Core Path. The Core Paths Network as a whole\
  \ should provide sufficient access opportunities for the full range of access takers,\
  \ including walkers, cyclists and horse riders, of varying abilities. The network\
  \ extends across the whole area with paths including trod paths across natural ground,\
  \ farm and forest tracks as well as minor roads and footways beside public roads.</p>"
