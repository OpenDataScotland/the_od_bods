notes: <p>Local Development Plan 2020Settlement Designations set out the current and
  proposed land uses related to the boundaries for the primary, secondary and third
  tier settlements. In general the land use designations indicate the types of uses
  that will be acceptable under the terms of the plan. However any proposal for development
  will also have to satisfy the key governing policies that are set out in the Policy
  section of the Local Development Plan.</p>
