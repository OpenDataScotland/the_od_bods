notes: "<p>Bill Gibb (1943-1988), born in <strong>New Pitsligo</strong>, Aberdeenshire,\
  \ was an <strong>international fashion designer</strong> with world famous clients.\
  \ In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue\
  \ magazine as <strong>Dress of the Year</strong>. Two years later he formed his\
  \ own fashion house, <strong>Bill Gibb Ltd</strong>, and launched his first solo\
  \ collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling\
  \ combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer\
  \ Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also\
  \ gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model\
  \ Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients\
  \ until his death.   </p>\n<p>In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches\
  \ was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters\
  \ including the <strong>Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums</strong>. We\
  \ continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill\
  \ Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other\
  \ items associated with him.   </p>\n<p>To discover the full extent of the collection\
