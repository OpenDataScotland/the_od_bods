notes: <p>Private Water Supplies User (Moray)Reg 2 (previously Cat A) are supplies
  which are commercial (including private lets) or more than 50 persons Category B
  are non-commercial with less than 50 persons.NOTE:- The location data we hold for
  the private water supplies is not 100% accurate (easting's and northing's can be
  out but we are currently working on improving these through GPS, unfortunately I
  cannot provide a figure on the accuracy, some maybe just in a general area of the
  property it serves).The data may contain multiple records for the same source reference,
  this may be where either multiple source abstractions points are located or there
  are other private water supply infrastructure located eg storage tanks. The location
  Type indicates the type:- A or A1 etc = Source, B or B1 etc = supply infrastructure,
  U or U1 etc = unused supply infrastructure. Sites marked with "Y" confirmed are
  for sites where we have visited site and obtained more accurate locations. The list
  does not include historic private water supplies. The data is provided based on
  the best information available to the council at the time of writing.</p>
