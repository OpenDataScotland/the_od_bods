notes: "<p>Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection (ARHAI) Scotland,\
  \ part of National Services Scotland works closely with Public Health Scotland to\
  \ deliver the COVID-19 response. This dataset provides data for COVID-19 hospital\
  \ onset cases in Scotland for week ending 1 March 2020 onwards, as available.</p>\n\
  <p>COVID-19 cases first diagnosed within hospital in-patients are classed as hospital\
  \ onset COVID-19, with the length of time between admission and their first COVID-19\
  \ positive sample determining their hospital onset status. \nARHAI Scotland is working\
  \ with NHS boards on a continuous basis to validate COVID-19 hospital onset cases\
  \ to ensure the data are robust. Data are published on the Open Data platform at\
  \ NHS Scotland level, by week of specimen date.</p>\n<p>All publications and supporting\
  \ material to this topic area can be found in the weekly <a href=\"https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/hospital-onset-covid-19-cases-in-scotland/\"\
