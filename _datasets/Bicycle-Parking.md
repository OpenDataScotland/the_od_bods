title: Bicycle Parking
organization: Dundee City Council
notes: The Council's Active Travel team conducted a survey of bicycle parking in 2015, with the results used to add or update cycle parking in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). 

This dataset is an extract of the current cycle parking in OpenStreetMap. If you see a facility missing or would like to update any of the information you can do this on OpenStreetMap yourself.
