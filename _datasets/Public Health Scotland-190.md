notes: "<p>Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified by a positive SARS-CoV-2\
  \ viral PCR test result.        </p>\n<p>For any individual, the specimen date of\
  \ their first positive viral PCR result is taken as the date of onset of their first\
  \ episode of COVID-19.      <br />\nSubsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen\
  \ date within 90 days of their first positive result are discounted.    <br />\n\
  If the individual then has a positive viral PCR result with specimen date \u2265\
  90 days after their first positive result, this is taken as the date of onset of\
  \ their second episode of COVID-19.     <br />\nSubsequent positive viral PCR results\
  \ with specimen date within 90 days of this second index date are then discounted\
  \ as for the first episode of COVID, and so on.     </p>\n<p>Confirmed cases of\
  \ COVID-19 have been identified as occurring in pregnancy if the date of onset of\
  \ the episode of COVID-19 occurred at any point from the estimated date of conception\
  \ (date the woman was 2+0 weeks gestation) up to and including the date the pregnancy\
  \ ended.       </p>\n<p>Traditionally, pregnancies were dated from the first day\
  \ of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP) prior to her pregnancy, with this date\
  \ being set as the first day of gestation (0+0 weeks) and babies being 'due' at\
  \ 40+0 weeks.    <br />\nConception, and hence the actual start of the pregnancy,\
  \ usually occurs around 2 weeks after the first day of the LMP, at 2+0 gestation.\
  \      <br />\nThese days, pregnancies are usually dated based on an ultrasound\
  \ scan done in early pregnancy and the woman's LMP date, but this dating convention\
  \ is still used, i.e. the date of conception is set at 2+0 weeks gestation.    \
  \    </p>\n<p>Broadly the three trimesters of pregnancy divide pregnancies into\
  \ three approximately equal time periods covering early, mid, and later pregnancy\
  \     <br />\nHowever, there is no internationally agreed definition of the exact\
  \ start and end point of each trimester     <br />\nHere we have used the definitions\
  \ recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists      <br\
  \ />\nhttps://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/05/methods-for-estimating-the-due-date\
  \    <br />\nThe most critical period for a baby's development is between 2+0 and\
  \ 9+6 weeks gestation: this is the period when all the major organs in the body\
  \ are formed       </p>\n<p>As the testing data is more up to date than the pregnancy\
  \ data, we have assumed that any woman showing as 44+0 weeks gestation or over at\
  \ the date of onset of an episode of COVID-19 was in fact no longer pregnant at\
  \ that time and this has not been counted as an infection in pregnancy.     <br\
  \ />\nAs described in the Data sources tab, these data lag issues will be resolved\
  \ over time as pregnancy related records are returned to PHS and incorporated into\
  \ the COPS study database of pregnant women.        </p>\n<p>The COPS study database\
  \ includes women aged 11 to 55 years inclusive at the time of conception.      \
  \   </p>\n<p>An unlinked analysis has been used to calculate rates of infection\
  \ among pregnant women.      <br />\nThe denominator for this analysis is a 'snapshot'\
  \ of the number of women pregnant at the start of the specified month.    <br />\n\
  The numerator is the number of women with onset of COVID-19 during pregnancy at\
  \ any point during the specified month.       </p>"
