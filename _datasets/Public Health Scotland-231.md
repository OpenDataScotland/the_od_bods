notes: "<p>This release presents data on quit attempts made with the help of NHS stop\
  \ smoking services during the financial years, 2009/10 \u2013 2019/20, and the outcomes\
  \ of those quit attempts. Information is presented at national, NHS Board and Local\
  \ Authority level along with breakdowns including age, gender, and deprivation.\
  \ Statistics are based on total \u2018quit attempts\u2019 made during the year,\
  \ rather than total number of clients with a quit attempt, so could include repeat\
  \ quit attempts for the same client. </p>\n<p>All publications and supporting material\
