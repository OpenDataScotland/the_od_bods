notes: '<p>There are two methods of standardising: direct and indirect. </p>

  <p>Both methods rely upon reference to a single standard population, which has a
  known population structure (in the case of direct standardisation) or known age-specific
  rates (in the case of indirect standardisation). The choice of standard population
  is important, as it influences the standardised rates or ratios obtained.</p>'
