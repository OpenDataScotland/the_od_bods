notes: "<p>Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified\
  \ in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness\
  \ to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic\
  \ has wider impacts on individuals\u2019 health, and their use of healthcare services,\
  \ than those that occur as the direct result of infection. Reasons for this may\
  \ include:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Individuals being reluctant to use health services because\
  \ they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.</p>\n\
  <p>\u2022 The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some\
  \ screening services and planned surgery.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Other indirect effects\
  \ of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences\
  \ of distancing measures.</p>\n<p>This dataset provides information on trend data\
  \ regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on the number of deaths in Scotland,\
  \ derived from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) <a href=\"https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/covid19stats\"\
  >weekly deaths registration data</a>. Data show recent trends in deaths (2020),\
  \ whether COVID or non-COVID related, and historic trends for comparison (five-year\
  \ average, 2015-2019). The recent trend data are shown by age group and sex, and\
  \ the national data are also shown by broad area deprivation category (Scottish\
  \ Index of Multiple Deprivation, SIMD).</p>\n<p>This data is also available on the\
