notes: '<p>OS Open Names is a geographic directory that contains basic information
  about identifiable places (Named Place). The content of the Product is divided into
  themes based on their type and local type classification values. The primary use
  of the product is to provide the location for a named place to support discovery
  or identification and visualisation, geocoding, routing and navigation and linking
  diverse information about a place (for example, statistics or descriptions). The
  name of the place will be the key property used for querying. It is also recognised
  that a place may have multiple names; an official name, which may be defined in
  multiple languages (English/Welsh or English/Gaelic), for example, Cardiff (English)
  and Caerdydd (Welsh). Names are not unique so additional location information is
  provided to enable users to refine their query to select the Named Place they are
  interested in. These include: postcode district, populated place, district/borough,
  county/unitary authority, European region and country. The OS Open Names specification
  will extend the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community
  (INSPIRE) Geographical Names theme to ensure that it is compliant with European
  open data initiatives.</p>'
