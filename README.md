We've now published [a blog post](https://codethecity.org/2021/06/13/3689/) about this project. 

The aim of this project at [CTC23](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC23) is to start collate access to Open Data in Scotland, beginning with cities. 

## Methodology

We started by looking at Scottish Cities' open data portals (where these could be found). One source was the work that [Ian](https://github.com/watty62) did in his last [audit of Scottish Open Data](https://github.com/watty62/SOD/blob/master/Local_authorities.md) . 




## What we are building

- A list of data sources and what they contain
- Script to pull data from existing platforms
   - CKAN
   - ArcGIS
- A front-end to present an aggregation of datasets from all the platforms


## Lessons Learned

- There is a lack of good quality open datasets published by local authorities
- There is no common taxonomy for categorising datasets
- There is no facility to aggregate a common dataset accross all 32 local authorities (e.g. cycle paths)
- There is no centralised, national portal for accessing open data in Scotland
