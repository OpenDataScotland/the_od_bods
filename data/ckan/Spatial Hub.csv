AQMAs must be designated officially by means of an 'order'.  The extent of the AQMA may be limited to the area of exceedance or encompass a larger area.  Following the declaration of an AQMA, the local authority is required to develop and implement a plan (Air Quality Action Plan) to improve air quality in that area. AQMAs can be for a combination of NO2, SO2, PM10.  Most data provided by local authorities is in polygon format. However, some is provided in point and line form so we are currently buffering such data by the width of a road or so in order to merge them in to the national polygon dataset. Some smaller local authorities e.g. Dundee, use the entire extent of their local authority, as digitised in Ordnance Survey's BoundaryLine dataset, for the AQMA.  We have included date of AQMA declaration in our national schema, though many LAs do not currently provide this. Revoked AQMAs are now held in this dataset with a 'Date revoked' attribute"

It is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.  This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Article 4 Directions dataset also published on a Scotland-wide basis."

Core paths are paths, waterways or any other means of crossing land to facilitate, promote and manage the exercise of access rights under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, and are identified as such in access authority core paths plan.  There are, intentionally, no set physical standards for core paths. This means that core paths can physically be anything from a faint line across a field to a fully constructed path, track or pavement. The National Access Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Government are encouraging information to be surveyed and made publicly available, in a nationally-standardised form, so that the public will know what physical type of route they can expect.

GHiGs Settlements:   A public summary of indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements. Settlement boundaries are from 2012 derived from National Records of Scotland to be consistent with those used by Scotland’s Heat Map v.2. Settlements are defined as places with populations greater than 500. Approximately 90% of Scotland’s population lives in settlements. It is not clear why Scotland’s Heat Map is using the NRS 2012 settlement boundaries rather than the more recent NRS 2016 settlement boundaries. Attributes were derived from Scotland’s Heat Map with additional attributes from GHiGs analysis and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs Settlements by LA:   A more comprehensive spreadsheet of tables used for National Findings Report and all indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements and, separately, the 32 Local Authorities. Settlement data aggregated to Local Authority geographies and presented based on OS BoundaryLine Local Authority boundaries. The data excludes areas outside settlements and therefore does NOT represent figures for complete local authorities. This is particularly evident for Local Authorities with more significant populations and businesses located outside of settlements. It includes most indicators used in the GHiGs National Findings report based on analysis of low carbon heat related data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements and then aggregated to 32 Local Authorities.  GHiGs greenspaces:   Boundaries derived from OS Mastermap Greenspace. Attributes derived from Scotland’s Heat Map v.2 with additional attributes from GHiGs analysis (see our Methodology Report) and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs strategic greenspaces:   Subset of GHiGs Greenspaces based on selection criteria to identify the 3% (3,446) of national greenspace sites with high potential for supply of ground source heat (based on areal size / capacity) and have been classified as ‘high’ based on local linear heat density. These sites are likely to be the strongest candidates for larger scale ground source heat solutions, potentially storing and feeding low grade heat into low carbon district heat networks. The ‘GSHP_Strategic_Importance’ indicator category of ‘VERY HIGH’ was used to select this subset  GHiGs static water bodies:   Relatively static water bodies greater than 1000m2 in area in proximity to urban settlements including canals, lochs, lakes, flooded quarries/pits etc. derived largely from OS Mastermap Greenspace. This data does not include rivers.  GHiGs DHN highest viability (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have highest viability based on heat demand from all buildings. Areas identifies have high levels of heat demand density and are therefore highly suitable for DHNs – source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have high viability based on heat demand from all buildings – source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN viable (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) are viable based on heat demand from all buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability. Polygons of area less than 250m2 were deleted which reduced the number of polygon features by 80% to cut file size. Source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN highest viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have highest viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have high viability based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN viable public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks are viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability – source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs public buildings:   Subset of Scotland’s Heat Map at building level where buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes (see GHiGs Methodology report for details). This is the best available approximation of publicly owned buildings but will exclude those publicly owned buildings which are leased to third parties for more commercial-type services. This same identification method was the basis for creating the 3 Linear Heat Density map layers for public buildings only.  GHiGs public buildings with heat demand greater than 50 MWh/year:  Subset of ‘GHiGs public buildings’ dataset based on a filter for all those public buildings with an annual heat demand of 50 MWh or more. Multi-occupancy buildings like flatted properties are treated as separate buildings and therefore they are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs public buildings (>200 MWh) near greenspaces (>200 MWh):  Subset of ‘GHiGs public buildings’ dataset where: (1) buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes and have a heat demand of at least 200 MWh; AND (2) they are located within 50m of a greenspace that, based on 20% space utilisation, could meet at least 200 MWh in terms of heat production from its available area. In effect this is a subset of public building locations that offers the strongest opportunities for larger scale GSHP projects based on use of nearby greenspace. Multi-occupancy buildings like flatted properties are treated as separate buildings and therefore examples such as high rise flats next to larger areas of greenspace are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs waste disposal sites:  Potential sources of waste heat from waste disposal sites to feed into district heat networks – source: SEPA registered waste sites   All GHiGs datasets cover Scotland and have been derived over the project period of September 2020 to April 2021.

Principal third party data suppliers include:  - Ordnance Survey (greenspace and water body data)  - Scottish Government (Scotland’s Heat Map)  - Energy Saving Trust (Home Analytics)  Please reference the Data Guide and Methodology report (attached to the metadata record as an associated resource) and send any further queries on the quality/ accuracy of the data to parkpower@greenspacescotland.org.uk.   GHiGs Settlements:   A public summary of indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements. Settlement boundaries are from 2012 derived from National Records of Scotland to be consistent with those used by Scotland’s Heat Map v.2. Settlements are defined as places with populations greater than 500. Approximately 90% of Scotland’s population lives in settlements. It is not clear why Scotland’s Heat Map is using the NRS 2012 settlement boundaries rather than the more recent NRS 2016 settlement boundaries. Attributes were derived from Scotland’s Heat Map with additional attributes from GHiGs analysis and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs Settlements by LA:   A more comprehensive spreadsheet of tables used for National Findings Report and all indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements and, separately, the 32 Local Authorities. Settlement data aggregated to Local Authority geographies and presented based on OS BoundaryLine Local Authority boundaries. The data excludes areas outside settlements and therefore does NOT represent figures for complete local authorities. This is particularly evident for Local Authorities with more significant populations and businesses located outside of settlements. It includes most indicators used in the GHiGs National Findings report based on analysis of low carbon heat related data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements and then aggregated to 32 Local Authorities.  GHiGs greenspaces:   Boundaries derived from OS Mastermap Greenspace. Attributes derived from Scotland’s Heat Map v.2 with additional attributes from GHiGs analysis (see our Methodology Report) and EST Home Analytics  GHiGs strategic greenspaces:   Subset of GHiGs Greenspaces based on selection criteria to identify the 3% (3,446) of national greenspace sites with high potential for supply of ground source heat (based on areal size / capacity) and have been classified as ‘high’ based on local linear heat density. These sites are likely to be the strongest candidates for larger scale ground source heat solutions, potentially storing and feeding low grade heat into low carbon district heat networks. The ‘GSHP_Strategic_Importance’ indicator category of ‘VERY HIGH’ was used to select this subset  GHiGs static water bodies:   Relatively static water bodies greater than 1000m2 in area in proximity to urban settlements including canals, lochs, lakes, flooded quarries/pits etc. derived largely from OS Mastermap Greenspace. This data does not include rivers.  GHiGs DHN highest viability (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have highest viability based on heat demand from all buildings. Areas identifies have high levels of heat demand density and are therefore highly suitable for DHNs – source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) have high viability based on heat demand from all buildings – source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN viable (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll to highlight areas where District Heat Networks (DHNs) are viable based on heat demand from all buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability. Polygons of area less than 250m2 were deleted which reduced the number of polygon features by 80% to cut file size. Source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN highest viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 16000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have highest viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN high viability public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 8000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks have high viability based on heat demand from only public buildings. Source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs DHN viable public buildings only (Linear Heat Density 4000 kWh/m/yr):   Linear Heat Density model created by Ramboll based on a best estimate of public buildings to highlight areas where District Heat Networks are viable based on heat demand from only public buildings. Threshold of 4000 is widely used across the industry for Linear Heat Density modelling to identify areas with DHN viability – source of heat demand data: Scotland’s Heat Map v2.  GHiGs public buildings:   Subset of Scotland’s Heat Map at building level where buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes (see GHiGs Methodology report for details). This is the best available approximation of publicly owned buildings but will exclude those publicly owned buildings which are leased to third parties for more commercial-type services. This same identification method was the basis for creating the 3 Linear Heat Density map layers for public buildings only.  GHiGs public buildings with heat demand greater than 50 MWh/year:  Subset of ‘GHiGs public buildings’ dataset based on a filter for all those public buildings with an annual heat demand of 50 MWh or more. Multi-occupancy buildings like flatted properties are treated as separate buildings and therefore they are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs public buildings (>200 MWh) near greenspaces (>200 MWh):  Subset of ‘GHiGs public buildings’ dataset where: (1) buildings are assessed as likely to be publicly owned based on a selection of 125 OS AddressBase codes and have a heat demand of at least 200 MWh; AND (2) they are located within 50m of a greenspace that, based on 20% space utilisation, could meet at least 200 MWh in terms of heat production from its available area. In effect this is a subset of public building locations that offers the strongest opportunities for larger scale GSHP projects based on use of nearby greenspace. Multi-occupancy buildings like flatted properties are treated as separate buildings and therefore examples such as high rise flats next to larger areas of greenspace are unlikely to appear in this dataset.  GHiGs waste disposal sites:  Potential sources of waste heat from waste disposal sites to feed into district heat networks – source: SEPA registered waste sites   All GHiGs datasets cover Scotland and have been derived over the project period of September 2020 to April 2021.

SMRs were established from the 1960s onwards in response to the loss of the archaeological resource through urban and rural development. From their original remit of recording archaeological sites, they have been developed to encompass a wide range of information about the historic environment which has been reflected in the change of name from SMR to HER. Today they provide a unique information resource, forming the basis for sustainable conservation and playing an important role in informing public understanding and enjoyment of the local historic environment. The historic environment includes all aspects of our surroundings that have been built, formed or influenced by human activities from earliest to most recent times.

This, in turn, helps inform land releases within the Local Development Plan process and ongoing development management decisions. A five-year effective housing land supply is required at all times.  This dataset contains full details - where available - of site references, site size (hectares), capacity (in housing units), completions, remaining supply and annual forecast phasing over a period of years, also a record of past completions, including aggregations of 2009 and earlier and 2027 and beyond, where these have been grouped as such. Further details of greenfield/brownfield status, tenure, effectiveness (deliverable within the period), constraints, planning details/status and developer are also provided where available.  The datasets have been drawn from a variety of sources, including comprehensive regional datasets (ClydePlan) and the joining of spatial and tabular data. This includes allocated and planned sites, which typically have fuller details of forecast phasing (etc) and also ""windfall"" and small sites (where included), which may be one-off rather than longer-term developments, with less detail. Some of these sites lack spatial geometry and have been represented by a square buffer on a recorded X/Y easting/northing, based on site size, if this information is available."

This will also be resolved, in data architecture terms, through dialogue with these key agencies.  Geometries  There are three layers within this dataset, for point, polyline and polygon features. Not all authorities capture all three feature types.   Categorisation  The dataset employs three levels of categorisation – class, subclass and tags. The classes and subclasses are listed below, based on a particular data attribute field that originates in the dataset and is mapped to the common attribute “layer type” which is then searched for an applicable match. Tags are used in searches to match and categorise dataset features against the layer type, and captured as a full list of tags against each feature to allow multi-criteria searches.  Known Issues  Some manual classification is required, for features that have only a reference or a layer name that needs direct matching to a class and subclass. In this case, the tags may well have null values.   This is an early release of the dataset, which will change further following consultation with users, planning authorities and other stakeholders. In the longer term, a move towards common standards and categorisation will be promoted.   Further Information  The definitive description is contained within the published Development Plan Scheme for each planning authority, available online.   Reference can also be made to Scottish Government policy on development plans:   https://www.gov.scot/policies/planning-architecture/development-plans/"

Scotland had a great tradition of publishing descriptive (long-form) gazetteers in the 19th century.   This dataset is the GIS point format output from a project funded by the Scottish Government in the early 2010s, to create a Definitive Place-Name Gazetteer for Scotland, which helped meet the INSPIRE requirements for a place-name layer. The data also forms the underlying content for the Gazetteer for Scotland web pages: https://www.scottish-places.info/   In 2009 a workshop was run in conjunction with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) to examine the range of gazetteers in use in Scotland, together with a broad set of requirements. This identified a number of organisations which hold or maintain at least 15 different gazetteers that include geographical names for Scotland. The two most significant gazetteers were the Gazetteer for Scotland and the Ordnance Survey 1:50000 (OS 1:50K) product – which forms the basis for this dataset.   The Gazetteer for Scotland is a descriptive gazetteer, with a modest number (22,000) of rich entries, including a textual description and rich feature-typing. The OS 1:50K gazetteer has long been Ordnance Survey's only place-name gazetteer, used as part of numerous applications.  It was decided that, for this new 'definitive' place name gazetteer, any named feature could/ should potentially be included, but it was accepted that the list will always be incomplete.   This dataset could be used (and potentially linked with) other datasets like the One Scotland Gazetteer and the Historical Names gazetteer.  The methodology for this data was a combination of automated and manual editing. Automated methods were used in feature classification and duplicate detection. Manual editing was required both to confirm or provide a feature classification, but also to improve the spatial referencing.  Standards had to be adopted; for example water bodies were spatially located by a point which approximated its centre while rivers were spatially located at their termination and other liner features by a random point along their length. The former gives a useful spatial reference, the latter in many cases does not.  Quality checking suggests that 95% of points were located to 100m or better, and 5% located to 20m or better. More than 90% of features are classified correctly, on the basis of the evidence available"

For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland is put into one of three categories – 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are likely to raise. Most applications will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and energy-related developments, and larger retail developments. 'National' developments are specific projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework because of their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a small minority of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine national interest.  This dataset consists of 4 separate layers:   1. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Points):  A point layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for all Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This should be a complete dataset across Scotland using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode as corresponding geometry. This is categorised by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list. 2.

Under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and Under part 6, section 37 of the Water Resources (Scotland) Act 2013 SEPA, Scottish Water and Local Authorities all have a responsibility for the registration, management and compliance of Septic Tanks within Scotland. The Scottish Assessors also currently identifies 678 septic tanks. These are tanks that serve more than one dwelling. Those that serve just one dwelling may be treated as an appurtenance of the dwelling i.e. they are classified as domestic and treated as being reflected in the Council Tax band.  SEPA have approximately a quarter of the Septic Tanks mapped as it has only been a requirement since 2012 that when buying or selling a house that these get licenced. Scottish Water have partial information (not included as data not provided in a suitable format) and Scottish Assessors collect some as well (not included due to percieved licensing restrictions). SEPA, Local Authorities, Scottish Water and Scottish Assessors are keen to combine data to create a complete and comprehensive view of all Septic Tanks in Scotland."

The dataset is created under the provisions as listed within The Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation Order and Trees in Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2010. Spatial and attribute data is maintained in ArcMap shapefile with extra attributes in a spreadsheet (including link to TPO PDF). Planning technicians ensure that data is updated regularly once new information about a TPO is provided, a new TPO is registered or a TPO has been removed. The conservation officers or senior management advise and direct planning technicians to create a draft TPO location plan which is then sent to the paralegal team. The paralegals then carry out their duties in confirming and registering the TPO and informing any interested party. The planning technician then updates the spatial data in ArcMap which, once finalised, is then sent to GIS staff to update into Location Centre. The data will be of interest to staff within PKC who are interested in identifying or collecting TPO data for their own professional purposes e.g. Development Management (planning application, LDP , supplementary guidance) and Greenspace (maintenance and retention of natural assets). The dataset is available for general public use, stakeholders or any interested party outside the Council to identify TPOs."

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

Further consideration will be required to demonstrate that any significant effects on the qualities of these areas can be substantially overcome by siting, design or other mitigation.  National and international designations: 		World Heritage Sites; 		Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites; 		Sites of Special Scientific Interest; 		National Nature Reserves; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields.  Other nationally important mapped environmental interests: 		areas of wild land as shown on the 2014 NatureScot map of wild land areas; 		carbon rich soils, deep peat and priority peatland habitat.  Community separation for consideration of visual impact: an area not exceeding 2km around cities, towns and villages identified on the local development plan with an identified settlement envelope or edge. The extent of the area will be determined by the planning authority based on landform and other features which restrict views out from the settlement.  Group 3 - Area with potential for wind farm development:  Beyond groups 1 and 2, wind farms are likely to be acceptable, subject to detailed consideration against identified policy criteria. Reference should be made to Scottish Government planning and renewable energy policy. In the first instance, this is Scottish Planning Policy (June 2014) paragraphs 161 to 174, in the context of the overarching policy of ""A Low Carbon Place"".  It should be noted that some terminology relating to ""spatial frameworks"" and ""areas of search"" may no longer be in use, and reference should be made to planning advice on renewable energy (February 2017) at https://www.gov.scot/publications/renewables-planning-advice-index/"
