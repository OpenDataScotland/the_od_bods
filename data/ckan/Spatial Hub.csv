AQMAs must be designated officially by means of an 'order'.  The extent of the AQMA may be limited to the area of exceedance or encompass a larger area.  Following the declaration of an AQMA, the local authority is required to develop and implement a plan (Air Quality Action Plan) to improve air quality in that area. AQMAs can be for a combination of NO2, SO2, PM10.  Most data provided by local authorities is in polygon format. However, some is provided in point and line form so we are currently buffering such data by the width of a road or so in order to merge them in to the national polygon dataset. Some smaller local authorities e.g. Dundee, use the entire extent of their local authority, as digitised in Ordnance Survey's BoundaryLine dataset, for the AQMA.  We have included date of AQMA declaration in our national schema, though many LAs do not currently provide this. Revoked AQMAs are now held in this dataset with a 'Date revoked' attribute."

These gaps either require amendment at source or approval for the IS to change.      ""name"", ""url"" and ""status"" are now MANDATORY fields for this dataset.

An Article 4 Direction is not a conservation designation but an additional control within such areas. It is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.  This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Article 4 Directions dataset also published on a Scotland-wide basis."

Core paths are paths, waterways or any other means of crossing land to facilitate, promote and manage the exercise of access rights under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, and are identified as such in access authority core paths plan.  There are, intentionally, no set physical standards for core paths. This means that core paths can physically be anything from a faint line across a field to a fully constructed path, track or pavement. The National Access Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Government are encouraging information to be surveyed and made publicly available, in a nationally-standardised form, so that the public will know what physical type of route they can expect.

This means that the land is no longer subject to the laws that apply to croft land.   The Crofting Commission will usually only allow land to be decrofted using a part croft decrofting application if it is for a reasonable purpose. Some examples of reasonable purposes include:   - Building houses - Building harbours, piers, boat shelters, - Churches, - Schools, - Halls, or community centres  - Building roads  - Generating energy  - Purposes likely to provide employment for crofters and others in the locality  This dataset provides the actual polygons of decrofted areas with various details about status, type, date decrofted etc."

The user guide provides descriptions of each data variable used in creating the index. The basic rationale was to replicate for Scotland work that had been conducted previously but only in respect to England and Wales. The two indices are not strictly directly comparable due to data availability and spatial granularity but provide standalone snapshots of relative fuel poverty across Great Britain. The Scottish Index is fully open source and for purposes of transparency and repeatability this guide provides an open methodology and is accompanied by the underlying data. Data are provided in good faith ’as is’ and is the sole product of student effort as part of mentoring activities conducted by EDINA at the University. Each variable that was used in the Index was normalised relative to the individual values for that variable - which means the values presented in the underlying FPI data table do not represent the actual numbers for each local authority - merely the percentage relative to the other local authorities in Scotland. A separate file ”Fuel-poverty-index-raw-data-with-calc.csv” is available which contains the raw percentages used for the index along with a table containing the calculations used to obtain the final score and the main FPI data table.  Fuel Poverty Index Excel: This file contains each Scottish local authority's ability to pay score, demand score and final score which were all obtained from the several different variables. The raw data for these variables can be found in the Raw Data file and an explanation for each variable can be found in the User Guide document. The scores are between 1 to 100 and are normalised relative to each other. This means the final scores do not represent the actual physical values for each area.  Fuel Poverty Index csv: This file contains the normalised processed data that makes up the Scottish fuel poverty index with variables being in range of 1 to 100. Some variables have been weighted depending on how important they are to the index. The final scores rating each Scottish local authority from 1 to 100 are also included.  Raw data: This file contains the raw unprocessed data that the index was created from for all Scottish local authorities.   User Guide: This file contains the documentation of the process to create the index as well as descriptions of what each column in the Fuel Poverty Index csv file contain.

These sites are likely to be the strongest candidates for larger scale ground source heat solutions, potentially storing and feeding low grade heat into low carbon district heat networks. The ‘GSHP_Strategic_Importance’ indicator category of ‘VERY HIGH’ was used to select this subset  GHiGs static water bodies:   Relatively static water bodies greater than 1000m2 in area in proximity to urban settlements including canals, lochs, lakes, flooded quarries/pits etc. derived largely from OS Mastermap Greenspace.

This is the best available approximation of publicly owned buildings but will exclude those publicly owned buildings which are leased to third parties for more commercial-type services. This same identification method was the basis for creating the 3 Linear Heat Density map layers for public buildings only.  GHiGs public buildings with heat demand greater than 50 MWh/year:  Subset of ‘GHiGs public buildings’ dataset based on a filter for all those public buildings with an annual heat demand of 50 MWh or more.

SMRs were established from the 1960s onwards in response to the loss of the archaeological resource through urban and rural development. The expansion of SMR/HERs to almost full UK-wide cover by 2004 was driven largely by their role in land-use planning, which expanded after formal government guidance was issued in the early 1990s: in Scotland this comprised 'National Planning Policy Guideline 5 (NPPG 5)' and 'Planning Advice Note (PAN) 42 Archaeology - the Planning Process and Scheduled Monument Procedures' (these were first issued in 1994 and have been regularly reviewed and updated ever since). The protection and enhancement of the historic environment is a key policy of NPF4 (Policy 7), which states that development proposals should be informed by reference to HERs.   From their original remit of recording archaeological sites, HERs have been developed to encompass a wide range of information about the historic environment which has been reflected in their change of name from SMR. Today they provide a unique information resource, forming the basis for sustainable conservation and playing an important role in informing public understanding and enjoyment of the local historic environment. The historic environment includes all aspects of our surroundings that have been built, formed, or influenced by human activities from earliest to most recent times. The HER stores, and provides access to, systematically organised information about these surroundings in a given area. It is maintained and updated for public benefit in accordance with national and international standards and guidance.   An HER makes information accessible to all in order to:   •	advance knowledge and understanding of the historic environment.   •	inform its care and conservation.   •	inform public policies and decision-making on land use planning and management.   •	contribute to environmental improvement and economic regeneration.   •	contribute to education and social inclusion, and  •	encourage participation in the exploration, appreciation, and enjoyment of the historic environment.  Most Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) maintain records of the historic (archaeological, built, and occasionally natural) environment. Some LPAs group together to collate their standardised records. Specialist staff and archaeological services (e.g., the West of Scotland Archaeology Service) curate these records and also to provide specialist advice for land-use planning and public information services.  A few LPAs do not collate or curate an HER for their areas. Historic environment data hosted on the Spatial Hub for these LPA areas (listed below) is taken from the Canmore database, maintained by Historic Environment Scotland (HES).  It is important to note that Canmore data is not equivalent to HER data. HER data are spatially defined and dynamically curated to be relevant to land use management and historic change over time, while Canmore at its core is a spatial index to the archive holdings of HES in various formats. Therefore, Canmore-derived data should not be used for land management or planning purposes due to its fundamental difference from HER data.  This dataset has two distinct data layers:  •	Historic Environment Sites (i.e., known locations and extents of archaeological monuments, features, historic buildings, and findspots, as well as Areas of Archaeological Interest; places known, or likely, to be particularly rich in archaeological features)  •	Historic Environment Events (i.e., archaeological investigations and excavations, historic building surveys, environmental impact assessments etc.)  We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset, because of its size you should use it with a filter.

The authoritative data source is the originating data supplied by the planning authority and the authoritative plan is that which is published as approved and adopted by the planning authority, which may not be in a digital format.   Development plans set out the long term vision for where development should and shouldn’t happen in the places they cover. The local development plan is the principal land use planning document used in assessing applications for planning permission, based upon national, regional and local policies and proposals. It is the most significant material consideration in determining such applications and reference to the local development plan is essential for most types of proposed development. The main spatial element is typically the policies and proposals map, which is created from the data that is also used in this dataset. Some policies will be plan-wide, and not reproduced spatially, so this dataset contains policy data that is linked to a discrete area within the planning authority area.   In addition to the local development plan, reference should be made to National Planning Framework 4 and supplementary guidance that is included in the development plan.   This dataset will be updated as and when development plans are replaced and formally adopted by authorities, on a minimum quarterly basis in operational terms each year. Local development plans were previously replaced on a five year basis but this has since moved to a ten year cycle following the recent Planning Act.  This dataset should be used in conjunction with other planning related datasets available on the Spatial Hub, notably planning applications, conservation areas, housing land and employment land. There may be some duplication with related layers, due to the ways that particular authorities may share data, and this will be resolved on a layer-by-layer basis as this dataset (and others) are developed. This is also true for some national datasets, such as statutory designations for natural heritage: these typically originate with other agencies although they are often published as part of a local development plan. This will also be resolved, in data architecture terms, through dialogue with these key agencies.  Geometries  There are three layers within this dataset, for point, polyline and polygon features. Not all authorities capture all three feature types.   Categorisation  The dataset has a basic taxonomy of ""type"" which is a short description of the type of land use, where this can be identified, from the attribute data. Other attributes refer to ""feature_name"", a reproduction of what is provided that best fits the name of a site or area, similar for ""reference"" where such data is provided, and also ""year"" and ""status"" for the year of plan adoption, draft publication or proposal or similar.  Known Issues  This is an early release of the dataset, which will change further following consultation with users, planning authorities and other stakeholders. In the longer term, a move towards common standards and categorisation will be promoted.

This information takes the form of indicators that measure aspects of performance (for example, how much a service costs per user or how satisfied local people are with a service) across all areas of local government activity.  The LGBF provides high-level information designed to encourage councils to examine why variations in cost and performance are occurring between similar councils.

One of the LNCS working group's recommendations was that all local authorities should adopt the LNCS name in place of the many different local names. However, many councils still use alternative names for these sites such as Local Biodiversity Sites, Local Wildlife Sites, Local Geodiversity Sites and Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation.

The low temperatures (as low as 10°C) require heat pump technology to upgrade thermal energy to usable temperatures for heating homes or industrial applications. The intention of the mine water geothermal resource atlas is to highlight optimal areas to exploit MWG energy in Scotland. If the scale of Scotland’s mine water thermal resource, estimated at 12 GW, becomes better communicated we envisage that this atlas will prove influential for increasing the rate and success of MWG deployment. Ideally, the provision of feasible MWG sites will influence stakeholder decisions i.e., where to invest and develop land to make the best use of the low-carbon resource, resulting in MWG potential included as part of a standard appraisal for a residential or industrial development plan. Whilst it is acknowledged that focused expert input would be required to integrate surface heat demand and subsurface resources in detail, the atlas provides non-experts and decision makers with a first-pass high-level summary of the potential MWG resource located within their area of interest.  The four criteria for site selection are summarised below:  1. There are more than one (overlapping) mined seams. 2. The mined seams are deeper than 30 m to minimise subsidence risk. 3. The mine water head (i.e., mine “water table”) is not excessively deep (< 60 m below ground level) to avoid excessive pumping costs. 4. The mined seams are shallower than 250 m below ground level to minimise drilling costs.  As a result, this atlas has identified a total of 370.3 km2 across 19 local authority areas which are most suitable for MWG development.  Symbology: The calculated depths for mine water head (Criterion 3) are mapped in 10 m increments with shallower values (0 m – 20 m BGL) shown in shades of pink and deeper values (20 m - 60 m BGL) shown in shades of blue. Where mine water head is shallow (0 m - 20 m BGL) there may be some risk that reinjection may cause mine water heads to approach the surface (depending on the transmissivity of the workings). “Open loop with discharge” may be more feasible for areas with very shallow mine water (0 m - 20 m BGL), but may require additional permitting (discharge consents) and available land for treatment depending on water chemistry. Areas shaded blue (20 m - 60 m BGL) correlate with deeper mine water heads which are most suited to the ‘open-loop with reinjection’ configuration. Both configurations are presented in Walls et al. (2022) - https://doi.org/10.3390/en14196215. Depths greater than 60 m BGL are not included since they indicate situations which would face excessive pumping costs.  The Mine Water Geothermal Resource Atlas for Scotland (MiRAS) was the work of David Walls, a PhD researcher at the Universities of Strathclyde and Glasgow. David has been supervised by Dr Neil Burnside of the University of Strathclyde, David Banks of the University of Glasgow and Prof. Adrian Boyce of SUERC. The PhD studentship was funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and some of the analysis was funded through the John Mather Trust Rising Star Award. Further contextual details of this work including the input data, specific processing and quality assurance can be found in David’s PhD (How can optimal sites for mine water geothermal energy systems be identified and where are they in Scotland?) and accompanying paper (to be shared when available).

Scotland had a great tradition of publishing descriptive (long-form) gazetteers in the 19th century.   This dataset is the GIS point format output from a project funded by the Scottish Government in the early 2010s, to create a Definitive Place-Name Gazetteer for Scotland, which helped meet the INSPIRE requirements for a place-name layer. The data also forms the underlying content for the Gazetteer for Scotland web pages: https://www.scottish-places.info/   In 2009 a workshop was run in conjunction with the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) to examine the range of gazetteers in use in Scotland, together with a broad set of requirements. This identified a number of organisations which hold or maintain at least 15 different gazetteers that include geographical names for Scotland. The two most significant gazetteers were the Gazetteer for Scotland and the Ordnance Survey 1:50000 (OS 1:50K) product – which together form the basis for this dataset.   The Gazetteer for Scotland is a descriptive gazetteer, with a modest number (22,000) of rich entries, including a textual description and rich feature-typing. At the time of creation, the OS 1:50K gazetteer had long been Ordnance Survey's only place-name gazetteer, used as part of numerous applications.  It was decided that, for this new 'definitive' place name gazetteer, any named feature could/ should potentially be included, but it was accepted that the list will always be incomplete.   This dataset could be used (and potentially linked with) other datasets like the Ordnance Survey Open Names, the One Scotland Gazetteer and the Historical Names gazetteer.  The methodology for this data was a combination of automated and manual editing. Automated methods were used in feature classification and duplicate detection. Manual editing was required both to confirm or provide a feature classification, but also to improve the spatial referencing.  Standards had to be adopted; for example water bodies were spatially located by a point which approximated its centre, while rivers were spatially located at their termination and other liner features by a random point along their length. The former gives a useful spatial reference, the latter in many cases does not.  Quality checking suggests that 95% of points were located to 100m or better, and 5% located to 20m or better. More than 90% of features are classified correctly, on the basis of the evidence available.  Copyrights and acknowledgments. The dataset is (c) Bruce M.

LAs also have a duty to keep these polling arrangements under review. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced amendments to the 1983 Act (which in turn has been superseded by The Electoral Administration Act 2013). Now local authorities must conduct a full review (with public consultation) of its polling districts and polling places every four years, however adjustments to the boundaries of polling districts and the designation of polling places within LA wards can be proposed at any time in response to changes in ward boundaries or to the availability of premises that can be reasonably designated as polling places.  The Fifth Review of Electoral Arrangements concluded in May 2016 when the LGBCS made recommendations to Scottish Ministers for the number of Councillors and the electoral ward boundaries in each of Scotland's 32 local authorities. The review recommended changes in 30 LA areas of which all but 5 were accepted and came into force on 30th Sept 2016.

The Scottish Assessors also currently identifies 678 septic tanks. These are tanks that serve more than one dwelling. Those that serve just one dwelling may be treated as an appurtenance of the dwelling i.e. they are classified as domestic and treated as being reflected in the Council Tax band.  SEPA have approximately a quarter of the Septic Tanks mapped as it has only been a requirement since 2012 that when buying or selling a house that these get licenced. Scottish Water have partial information and the Scottish Assessors collect some as well.

The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated with the Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations are made to local authorities.   Every year the Scottish Government Communities Analytical Services produce a comprehensive national survey based on data collected and processed from all Local Authorities and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority. The Spatial Hub takes this survey data and joins it (using site ID) to the polygon site information provided by local authorities.  To create this dataset we have taken all of the spatial data provided by councils for the current survey year and combined it to this year's statistical survey (using the site reference). However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated with the Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations are made to Planning Authorities.  Every year the Scottish Government Communities Analysis Division produce a National Statistics statistical publication based on data collected and processed from all Local Authorities and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority. This includes an SVDLS Site Register. Where spatial data is provided by Planning Authorities, the data is reviewed to make sure it matches the published SVDLS Site Register.  Improvement Service then combine the spatial data with the SVDLS site Register for the current survey year (2023 published in 2024 for most authorities) and combined it to this year's SVDLS Site Register (using the site reference).   Where Planning Authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, their previous spatial data return has been used, or where there is no spatial data at all for site we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create a circular polygon area for the site.  The definitive data source is the SVDLS Site Register available here: https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-vacant-and-derelict-land-survey---site-register/  The Scottish Government vacant and derelict land statistics are also available as a map, and can be accessed at https://isshinyapps.shinyapps.io/SVDL_mapping_2023/  The map also shows planning application information as of October 2024, where a planning application has been submitted within an SVDL site boundary. This data is drawn directly from local authorities and does not form part of the Scottish Government vacant and derelict land statistical return or the Scottish Government Planning Applications statistical return. These statistics may be found on the Scottish Government Planning Statistics website: https://www.gov.scot/collections/planning-statistics/ -these data have been quality assured by the Scottish Government."

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

Further consideration will be required to demonstrate that any significant effects on the qualities of these areas can be substantially overcome by siting, design or other mitigation.  National and international designations: 		World Heritage Sites; 		Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites; 		Sites of Special Scientific Interest; 		National Nature Reserves; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields.  Other nationally important mapped environmental interests: 		areas of wild land as shown on the 2014 NatureScot map of wild land areas; 		carbon rich soils, deep peat and priority peatland habitat.  Community separation for consideration of visual impact: an area not exceeding 2km around cities, towns and villages identified on the local development plan with an identified settlement envelope or edge. The extent of the area will be determined by the planning authority based on landform and other features which restrict views out from the settlement.  Group 3 - Area with potential for wind farm development:  Beyond groups 1 and 2, wind farms are likely to be acceptable, subject to detailed consideration against identified policy criteria. Reference should be made to Scottish Government planning and renewable energy policy. In the first instance, this is Scottish Planning Policy (June 2014) paragraphs 161 to 174, in the context of the overarching policy of ""A Low Carbon Place"".  It should be noted that some terminology relating to ""spatial frameworks"" and ""areas of search"" may no longer be in use, and reference should be made to planning advice on renewable energy (February 2017) at https://www.gov.scot/publications/renewables-planning-advice-index/  NB. Some local authorities have only provided Group 3 areas so far."
