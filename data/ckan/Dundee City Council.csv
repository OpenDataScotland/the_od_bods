Deprivation in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of resources or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing and access to services as well as financial aspects. \r\n\r\nThe most recent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government on 31st August 2016. The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones with roughly an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then look at the indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38 indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains.

The SIMD allows organisations to target policies and place resources in the areas with greatest need. \r\n\r\nThe boundaries used to collate the SIMD changed in 2016 as the analysis was based on the 2011 data zones which were produced by the Scottish Government.  The previous SIMD\u2019s published by the Scottish Government were based on the Scottish Governments 2001 based data zones.
