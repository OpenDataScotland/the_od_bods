Vaccine uptake statistics among care home residents and those who are severely immunosuppressed will be reported initially. PHS will include further updates as the Spring/Summer vaccination programme rolls out._\r\n\r\n_In addition, as part of our continuous review of reporting, PHS made some changes to vaccine uptake statistics. From 24 March 2022, the deceased and those who no longer live in Scotland are no longer be included in vaccine uptake statistics.  Historic trend data have been updated to take into account this new methodology for all apart from the Daily Trends by JCVI Priority Group table (more details about the data in this table are below).  Scotland level data for all vaccinations administered (i.e. including those who have since died or moved from Scotland) are still available in the Daily Trend of All Vaccinations Delivered in Scotland table._\r\n\r\n_Also from 24 March 2022, Dose 3/Booster doses are termed \u201cDose 3\u201d._\r\n\r\n**To allow new data to be fully processed and available at 14:00, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable from 12:45 to 14:00. During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as usual.**\r\n\r\nPHS reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18 November 2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living population. From the 24 March 2022 those who are no longer living in Scotland have also been removed from the numerator and denominator for JCVI priority group uptake figures.\r\n\r\nThis means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators on these two dates and care should be taken when interpreting trends.\r\n\r\nOn 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.\r\n\r\nThese vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \r\n\r\nThose giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland followed the independent advice received from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf) and prioritised delivery of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended order of prioritisation.

Vaccine uptake statistics among care home residents and those who are severely immunosuppressed will be reported initially. PHS will include further updates as the Spring/Summer vaccination programme rolls out._\r\n\r\n_In addition, as part of our continuous review of reporting, PHS made some changes to vaccine uptake statistics. From 24 March 2022, the deceased and those who no longer live in Scotland are no longer be included in vaccine uptake statistics.  Historic trend data have been updated to take into account this new methodology for all apart from the Daily Trends by JCVI Priority Group table (more details about the data in this table are below).  Scotland level data for all vaccinations administered (i.e. including those who have since died or moved from Scotland) are still available in the Daily Trend of All Vaccinations Delivered in Scotland table._\r\n\r\n_Also from 24 March 2022, Dose 3/Booster doses are termed \u201cDose 3\u201d._\r\n\r\n**To allow new data to be fully processed and available at 14:00, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable from 12:45 to 14:00. During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as usual.**\r\n\r\nPHS reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18 November 2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living population. From the 24 March 2022 those who are no longer living in Scotland have also been removed from the numerator and denominator for JCVI priority group uptake figures.\r\n\r\nThis means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators on these two dates and care should be taken when interpreting trends.\r\n\r\nOn 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.\r\n\r\nThese vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \r\n\r\nThose giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive the vaccination.

However, how some elements of maternity care are delivered has changed in order to minimise the number of visits women need to make. The \u2018booking\u2019 appointment is the first main appointment a woman has with her local maternity service once she knows she is pregnant. At the booking appointment, women are assessed by a midwife who can then tailor the subsequent care they receive during their pregnancy to their particular preferences and needs. Women are encouraged to book before they are 13 weeks pregnant, and ideally before they are 10 weeks pregnant. \r\n\r\nIn general, prior to COVID-19, women were offered an initial in-person booking appointment (including various face to face tests such as blood tests and blood pressure monitoring) then a follow up appointment for their early pregnancy ultrasound scan. Since March 2020, in many areas women have been offered an initial remote consultation, then an in-person \u2018one stop\u2019 follow up appointment for all their face to face tests and their scan.\r\n\r\nThis dataset shows the number of women booking for antenatal care in each week from the week beginning 1 April 2019 onwards.

Termination of pregnancy can be carried out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical terminations involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart to end her pregnancy. Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately, the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then take both medicines at home.\r\n\r\nTermination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations. When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within seven days of it taking place. Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation of data derived from notifications of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the Chief Medical Officer. Detailed information on terminations is published each year by Public Health Scotland.

In 2011, the Scottish Government set a standard that 90% of people referred for help with problematic drug or alcohol use will wait no longer than three weeks for specialist treatment that supports their recovery. This data was extracted from the new Drug and Alcohol Information System (DAISy) and its predecessor the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Waiting Times (DATWT) database.

This dataset includes all probable and definite hospital onset COVID-19 cases. Data are published on the Open Data platform at NHS Scotland level, by week of specimen date.\r\n\r\nAll publications and supporting material to this topic area can be found in the weekly Hospital onset COVID-19 cases in Scotland publication. Further information on SARS-CoV-2 and current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance can be found in the National Infection Prevention and Control Manual. \r\n\r\nDue to the lower number of hospital onset COVID-19 cases, and to support NHS boards by reducing local Infection Prevention and Control Team resource required for surveillance, the last publication of this data was on 1 March 2023.\r\n"

This included the addition of 11 new datasets. For data files published prior to 12 October 2023, please see [Archived - COVID-19 Statistical Data in Scotland](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-in-scotland).\r\n\r\nThis dataset provides information on the number and rate of new weekly confirmed respiratory cases (including COVID-19, influenza and other non-influenza respiratory pathogens) at Scotland, NHS Board and Council Area (where available) level.\r\n\r\nThis publication includes information on socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and deprivation status for both cases and hospital admissions, along with trend data.\r\n\r\nData visualisation of Scottish COVID-19, influenza, and other respiratory pathogen cases is available on the\u202f[Public Health Scotland - Covid 19 Scotland dashboard](https://publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/health-protection/infectious-diseases/covid-19/covid-19-data-and-intelligence/covid-19-daily-cases-in-scotland-dashboard/overview-of-the-covid-19-respiratory-surveillance-dashboard/).  Additional information can be found in the data dictionary for each dataset.\r\n\r\nTracking infectious respiratory diseases, including COVID-19 and influenza, is essential, especially in the winter when the disease burden can be highest. In Scotland, respiratory infection and associated morbidity are monitored using enhanced surveillance. This approach combines data from microbiological sampling and laboratory test results from community and hospital settings with data from syndromic surveillance of NHS 24 calls, primary care consultations for respiratory symptoms, hospital (including intensive care) admissions and other settings.
