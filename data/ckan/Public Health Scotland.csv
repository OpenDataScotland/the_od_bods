Further data on the wider impact of the COVID-19 response, focusing on hospital admissions, unscheduled care and volume of calls to NHS24, is available on the COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard.\r\n\r\nNovel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020. We now have spread of COVID-19 within communities in the UK. \r\n\r\n \r\nPublic Health Scotland no longer reports the number of COVID-19 deaths within 28 days of a first positive test from 2nd June 2022. Please refer to\u202f[NRS death certificate data](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland)\u202fas the single source for COVID-19 deaths data in Scotland. \r\n \r\nTo allow new data to be fully processed and available at 12:00 on a Wednesday, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable from 11:00 to 12:00. During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as usual. \r\n\r\nIn the process of updating the hospital admissions reporting to include reinfections, we have had to review existing methodology. In order to provide the best possible linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions, each admission record is required to have a discharge date, to allow us to better match the most appropriate COVID positive episode details to an admission. This means that in cases where the discharge date is missing (either due to the patient still being treated, delays in discharge information being submitted or data quality issues), it has to be estimated. Estimating a discharge date for historic records means that the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap with records of positive tests. \r\n\r\nThe result of these changes has meant that approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital. If a patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection is after their date of discharge from hospital, they are not included in the analysis. \r\n\r\nInformation on COVID-19, including stay at home advice for people who are self-isolating and their households, can be found on\u202f[NHS Inform](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice). \r\n\r\nData visualisation of Scottish COVID-19 cases is available on the\u202f[Public Health Scotland - Covid 19 Scotland dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phs.covid.19/viz/COVID-19DailyDashboard_15960160643010/Overview). \r\n\r\nFurther information on coronavirus in Scotland is available on the\u202f[Scottish Government \u2013 Coronavirus in Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/)\u202fpage, where further breakdown of\u202fpast [coronavirus data](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-daily-data-for-scotland/)\u202fhas also been published. \r\n\r\n "

Estimating a discharge date for historic records means that the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap with records of positive tests. \r\n\r\nThe result of these changes has meant that approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital.

The Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine has been used from 4 January 2021 and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April 2021. \r\n\r\nWomen can receive a first or second dose, or both doses, of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, depending on when they become eligible for vaccination and how this relates to the dates of their pregnancy.\r\n\r\nPHS has generated this information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to pregnant women by linking national data on vaccinations to the COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS) study database of pregnant women in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAs part of the COPS study, PHS is regularly linking together a wide range of health records to identify women who are, or recently have been, pregnant.

Termination of pregnancy can be carried out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical terminations involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart to end her pregnancy. Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately, the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then take both medicines at home.\r\n\r\nTermination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations. When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within seven days of it taking place. Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation of data derived from notifications of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the Chief Medical Officer. Detailed information on terminations is published each year by Public Health Scotland. The most recent report covers the year to December 2019.\r\n\r\nThis dataset presents information on the number of terminations of pregnancy carried out in Scotland, and the average gestation (stage of pregnancy) at which they occurred. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group and deprivation. \r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard.

Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately, the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then take both medicines at home.\r\n\r\nTermination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations. When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within seven days of it taking place. Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation of data derived from notifications of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the Chief Medical Officer. Detailed information on terminations is published each year by Public Health Scotland. The most recent report covers the year to December 2019.\r\n\r\nThis dataset presents information on the number of terminations of pregnancy carried out in Scotland, and the average gestation (stage of pregnancy) at which they occurred. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group and deprivation. \r\n\r\nThis data is also available on the COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard. Additional data sources relating to this topic area are provided in the Links section of the Metadata below.

This dataset includes all probable and definite hospital onset COVID-19 cases. Data are published on the Open Data platform at NHS Scotland level, by week of specimen date.\r\n\r\nAll publications and supporting material to this topic area can be found in the weekly Hospital onset COVID-19 cases in Scotland publication. Further information on SARS-CoV-2 and current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance can be found in the National Infection Prevention and Control Manual. \r\n\r\nDue to the lower number of hospital onset COVID-19 cases, and to support NHS boards by reducing local Infection Prevention and Control Team resource required for surveillance, the last publication of this data was on 1 March 2023.\r\n"

The intelligence generated from the different areas of surveillance provide a comprehensive picture of current respiratory illness in Scotland. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most influenza infections would be expected to occur in the winter months with a peak between December and March. There are three types of influenza virus, Type A, B and C, that cause illness in humans. Types A and B more commonly detected through testing. The virus undergoes some level of genetic change each year, often referred to as shift (major genetic change) or drift (minor genetic change); this is most notable for influenza A viruses. This genetic change causes different strains of the virus to predominate each season. As such, the number of people affected each year depends on how well the vaccine is matched against the circulating strain and how many people access the vaccination. \r\nThe key non-influenza respiratory pathogens include adenovirus, seasonal coronaviruses (non-SARS-CoV-2), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus. These mostly cause mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as the common cold, but infection can sometimes lead to more severe lower respiratory tract complications, especially in young children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
