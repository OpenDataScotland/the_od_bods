In particular, the proposed changes have been produced to align with new population data from the 2022 Census.</p><p>Data Zones are the key geography for the dissemination of small area statistics in Scotland and are widely used across the public sector. Composed of groups of Census Output Areas, Data Zones are large enough that statistics can be presented accurately without fear of disclosure and yet small enough that they can be used to represent communities. They are designed to have roughly standard populations of 500 to 1,000 household residents, nest within local authorities (at the time of the Census), and have compact shapes that respect physical boundaries where possible. When Data Zones were originally created for the 2001 Census, they were designed to contain households with similar social characteristics. Aggregations of Data Zones can be used to provide estimates for higher level geographies where official statistics might not otherwise be available. Data Zones also represent a relatively stable geography that can be used to analyse change over time, with changes only occurring after a Census. Following the update to Data Zones using 2022 Census data, there are now 7,392 Data Zones covering the whole of Scotland.</p><p><b>What are Data Zones and Intermediate Zones?</b></p><p>Data Zones are statistical geographies used to produce small area statistics at a local level. They are designed to have a population of between 500 and 1,000 people, making them small enough to describe communities while also being large enough to avoid disclosing personal information.</p><p>They serve two main functions in the production of official statistics. Firstly, they provide a standard, stable geography for the production and publication of statistics at a local area on a wide range of topics. Secondly, aggregations of Data Zones can be used to provide estimates for higher level geographies where official statistics might not otherwise be available.</p><p>Intermediate Zones are similar to Data Zones but cover a larger population and area.

This version (Version 2.1, July 2024) reflects changes to the data  and policy landscape which are detailed in the user guide below.</div><br />The  Priority Places for Food Index (https://priorityplaces.cdrc.ac.uk/) is  constructed using open data to capture complex and multidimensional  aspects of food insecurity risk. The index was initially developed in  response to the 2022 cost of living crisis which has put many of our  communities under severe financial pressure and at an increased risk of  food insecurity. Building on the CDRC e-food desert index (EFDI), but  with additional domains relating to fuel poverty and family food  support, the goal of the Priority Places for Food Index is to identify  neighbourhoods that are most vulnerable to increases in the cost of  living and which have a lack of accessibility to cheap, healthy, and  sustainable sources of food.<br /><br />From version 1 to version 2, data  have been updated across several of the seven PPFI domains. This  includes new area socio-demographics, foodbank, and food retailer  location data. Data relating to Free School Meal eligibility has also  been updated to reflect the changing policy landscape and to address  regional inconsistencies in policies. Areas may look different to  version one as a result of the new data incorporated or changes to  neighbourhood boundaries. Because of these data changes we recommend  that you don’t make comparisons between the versions.<br /><br />The index  can be used to inform supermarket location analytics, improve the  availability of budget food lines, and to ensure scare resources are  targeted effectively.<br /><br /><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Note: </span>Subject  to the Department of Health and Social Care making a statement  highlighting inaccuracies in the Healthy Start Uptake data between July  2023-February 2024, we have updated Version 2 of the Priority Places for  Food Index (PPFI). Version 2.1 of the PPFI replaces the October 2023  uptake of Healthy Start Vouchers values with the average voucher uptake  between January and June 2023 to minimise the impact on the Priority  Places for Food Index insights."

From the outset it is important to be clear that although the terms ‘count’ or ‘census’ are used, open range counting enables a population estimate to be made, but with associated error margins. Research has shown</span><span> </span><span>that, normally, estimates will vary by between 5 and 16%. In other words if you count 415 deer then the population estimate is at best between 348 and 481 (or at very best between 394 and 435). Open range population counts (and their resulting estimates) are therefore most likely to be useful for setting broad targets or giving an index of deer numbers as opposed to very precise population models. They are also useful for indicating trends in a series of counts.</span></p><p><span>Count information can be obtained by joining table DEER_COUNT_INDEX based on COUNT_ID columns.</span><span> </span><span>Both Helicopter and ground counts are included in the data. The </span><span>m</span><span>ajority of the data were collected in </span><span>‘white ground’ </span><span>conditions </span><span>where the contrast between deer and the background </span><span>of snow is</span><span> </span><span>maximised enabling deer to be more easily spotted.</span><span> </span><span>Summer counts of 'Priority' sites are also included where sites have been counted more intensively.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p style='text-align:Center;font-weight:bold;margin:0 0 0 0;'><span><span>Attribute Name</span></span></p></td><td><p

The dataset is also an amalgamation of two records sets therefore some elements are incomplete or missing, including site locations and coordinates. Historic Environment Records Events, this dataset is points only.</b></div><div><br /></div><div>HERs (Historic Environment Records) developed out of SMRs (Sites and Monuments Records). SMRs were established from the 1960s onwards in response to the loss of the archaeological resource through urban and rural development. From their original remit of recording archaeological sites, they have been developed to encompass a wide range of information about the historic environment which has been reflected in the change of name from SMR to HER. Today they provide a unique information resource, forming the basis for sustainable conservation and playing an important role in informing public understanding and enjoyment of the local historic environment. The historic environment includes all aspects of our surroundings that have been built, formed or influenced by human activities from earliest to most recent times. A Historic Environment Record stores and provides access to systematically organised information about these surroundings in a given area. It is maintained and updated for public benefit in accordance with national and international standards and guidance. An HER makes information accessible to all in order to: - advance knowledge and understanding of the historic environment; - inform its care and conservation; - inform public policies and decision-making on land-use planning and management; - contribute to environmental improvement and economic regeneration; - contribute to education and social inclusion; - encourage participation in the exploration, appreciation and enjoyment of the historic environment.</div><div><br /></div><div>Local authorities and most National Park authorities maintain records of the archaeological, built and natural environment. However, many services group together to form archaeological services to collate their standardised records. Specialist staff are employed to curate these records and also to provide specialist advice for land-use planning and public information services.</div><div><br /></div><div>This dataset has two distinct data layers: - Historic Environment Sites (including Known Site Extents and Areas of Archaeological Interest) - Historic Environment Events (also known as interventions)</div>"
