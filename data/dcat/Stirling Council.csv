This version (Version 2.1, July 2024) reflects changes to the data  and policy landscape which are detailed in the user guide below.</div><br />The  Priority Places for Food Index (https://priorityplaces.cdrc.ac.uk/) is  constructed using open data to capture complex and multidimensional  aspects of food insecurity risk. The index was initially developed in  response to the 2022 cost of living crisis which has put many of our  communities under severe financial pressure and at an increased risk of  food insecurity. Building on the CDRC e-food desert index (EFDI), but  with additional domains relating to fuel poverty and family food  support, the goal of the Priority Places for Food Index is to identify  neighbourhoods that are most vulnerable to increases in the cost of  living and which have a lack of accessibility to cheap, healthy, and  sustainable sources of food.<br /><br />From version 1 to version 2, data  have been updated across several of the seven PPFI domains. This  includes new area socio-demographics, foodbank, and food retailer  location data. Data relating to Free School Meal eligibility has also  been updated to reflect the changing policy landscape and to address  regional inconsistencies in policies. Areas may look different to  version one as a result of the new data incorporated or changes to  neighbourhood boundaries. Because of these data changes we recommend  that you don’t make comparisons between the versions.<br /><br />The index  can be used to inform supermarket location analytics, improve the  availability of budget food lines, and to ensure scare resources are  targeted effectively.<br /><br /><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Note: </span>Subject  to the Department of Health and Social Care making a statement  highlighting inaccuracies in the Healthy Start Uptake data between July  2023-February 2024, we have updated Version 2 of the Priority Places for  Food Index (PPFI).
