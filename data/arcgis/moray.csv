Proposals associated with any other location will be dealt with under H7 (LDP2015), and assessed against criteria such as visual prominence; character; settlement pattern; build up. Boundaries have been drawn around these groupings, and there will be a presumption in favour of developments within this boundary. (The settlement boundary policy E9 (LDP2015) will apply).The concept of identifying and promoting rural development in existing “rural communities” was originally contained in the 1993-98 Plan. At that time they were identified as small rural settlements, which served as social focal points for the surrounding area, with the presence of one or more community facilities (school/hall/shop). In subsequent Plans, the requirement for community facilities has been reduced, and further groupings have been designated based on their status as a cohesive, physical grouping.
