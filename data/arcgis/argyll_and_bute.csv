Any route across land or inland water can be a Core Path. The Core Paths Network as a whole should provide sufficient access opportunities for the full range of access takers, including walkers, cyclists and horse riders, of varying abilities. The network extends across the whole area with paths including trod paths across natural ground, farm and forest tracks as well as minor roads and footways beside public roads."
