Support was given to help prepare a Forest Plan through the SRDP's Woodland Improvement Grant (WIG) for long-term forest planning. An approved Forest Plan will give a 10 year approval for felling, thinning and will provide the means of accessing grants for restructuring felling and regeneration and other grant support.    This dataset stores information on the Forest Plan boundary, the 1st and 2nd clearfell phases (1-5 years and 6-10 years) and areas managed under Low Impact Silvicultural Systems (LISS).    Basic attribute information is captured during the digitising process. This is subsequently joined to more comprehensive information which is entered in an Excel spreadsheet by Scottish Forestry Conservancy staff.

This programme was designed to support rural Scotland from 2007 to 2013. Individuals and groups were able to seek funding to help deliver the Government's strategic objectives in rural Scotland.    Woodlands are a vital sustainable natural resource and funding aims to encourage the creation of new woodlands with grants that will contribute to the cost of their establishment.

The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social benefits.

Forest Plans were introduced for landowners planning to carry out felling, restocking and thinning in their woodlands.    Forestry Commission Scotland provided a grant to help prepare a plan (Plan Preparation Grant) and owners could claim restocking grants set at the same rate as the Woodland Grant Scheme (1999 - 2003) or Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (2003 - 2006).    Once the plan was approved, a Forest Plan contract provided felling and restocking approval for 10 years.    Forest Plans (SFGS) were closed to new applications in December 2006.

This dataset relates to the second phase of the WIAT programme which started in April 2008.    This dataset contains new and upgraded footpaths from approved WIAT applications. Additionally there are datasets which show the case boundary and car parks for WIAT applications.    Additional information on WIAT can be found in the overall WIAT boundary dataset metadata which gives details on eligibility criteria and further details on the overall programme.

They are required as part of the eligibility criteria for SRDP grants. However no grant payments are available for the preparation of management plans.  The Management Plan must give a clear and concise description of the woodland and the indicative management proposals up to 10 years. These must be in accordance with the principles of sustainable forest management as defined by the UK Forestry Standard.    Basic attribute information is captured during the digitising process. This is subsequently joined to more comprehensive information which is entered in an Excel spreadsheet by Scottish Forestry Conservancy staff.

Following publication of the Scottish Executive’s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests for Scotland' the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social benefits.    Grants were available under three main areas:    Grants for woodland expansion - creating new woodlands. Restocking grants, for replanting following felling. Stewardship grants, for a range of activities in existing woodlands.    Applications for SFGS grants started in June 2003 and closed in August 2006.     Most grants for SFGS were based on a percentage of Standard Costs of agreed operations. The Standard Cost took account of the costs of labour, plants, machinery, materials and supervision to do work to the specification as set out in the SFGS Standard Costs and Specifications Booklet.    Depending upon the level of public benefit, grant payments were either at 60% or 90% of the Standard Cost. In the case of restocking, Standard Costs were mostly pitched at 75% of the new planting Standard Costs.    Grants were available for planting proposals that met one or more of the following objectives:    Establishing well-designed productive woodland. Expanding areas of native woodland, preferably through natural regeneration and the development of Forest Habitat Networks. Improving riparian habitat. Improving the quality and setting of urban or post-industrial areas. Improving the diversity of the farmed and crofting landscape.    Details of all eligible operations are set out within the 'Applicants Booklet' available from Conservancy Offices.
