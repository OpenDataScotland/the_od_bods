Stores, garages and properties relating to hostels and institutions have been excluded from the total stock count. Ownership information from this source relies to a considerable extent on residents notifying the Council that a change of tenure has taken place. Accordingly, the figures contained within this file may differ slightly from other estimates available which make use of additional data sources, such as tenure data from the Housing Benefits system, a housing stock file from the Glasgow Housing Association and the Statutory Register of Private Landlords. These tenure estimates were last undertaken for housing stock as it was in 2018, with the report going to Council committee in 2019. These estimates which are aggregated to neighbourhood level are available at:\u00a0<a href='https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=46229&amp;p=0The' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=46229&amp;p=0The</a>\u00a0ownership information from the various data sources does not always agree. This is a particular issue for private renting. For dwellings where the available evidence from the Council Tax Register and the Statutory Register of Private Landlords is not consistent, a more detailed tenure assessment was carried out, using a sample. The proportions for owner occupation and private renting from the sample have been used to estimate the tenure for dwellings where the tenure position is unclear.The owner occupied stock figures include shared ownership and shared equity properties. The social rented stock figures include mid-market rent housing. Housing at full market rent has been classified as private rented stock, irrespective of ownership.</span><div><br /></div></p>",

All pedestrian and cycle movement at these locations, to and from the city, are counted.<div><p>The City Centre Cordon Count\nwas undertaken annually between 2009 and 2018. The frequency changed to every 3\nyears due to the availability of the data produced by the suite of automatic\ncycle counters. The first count in the new schedule was programmed for 2021\nhowever, a supplementary count was undertaken in 2020 to measure the effects of\nthe global pandemic on active travel within the city cordon.\u00a0</p><br /></div>",

Since 2019, Urban Big Data Centre at University of\nGlasgow, Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Centre for Population Health have\nbeen collaborating on a project to combine Data Science with the city\u2019s\nexisting CCTV network to generate object count data.</p>\n\n<p>Selected CCTV cameras take a single frame image every 30\nminutes across the 40 plus cameras and the images are processed using machine\nlearning algorithms to detect and count various objects \u2013 the objects include\nperson, car, bicycle, motorcycle, bus and truck. The counts of objects in the\nframe are collected and returned via an API created to access and query the\ndata.</p>\n\n<p>Users can query the API to return data on object type,\nlocation and time periods since November 2019.</p>\n\n<p>As the data detects objects only once every 30 minutes the\ndata cannot be used to determine the absolute number of objects (such as\npersons) in one place over time. Rather the data should be used to compare the\ndifference in object counts between places at the same time or the same image\nframe over two or more time periods.</p>\n\n<span>Note that</span><span>\nthe camera images do not store or track individual images of people, rather the\nalgorithms are trained to recognise the outline shape of an object only and\ncount it every time it detects the object in the image frame. One of the image count\ndata are retained or stored after they have been counted.<br /></span>",
